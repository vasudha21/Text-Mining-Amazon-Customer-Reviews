https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/amazon_reviews_us_Mobile_Electronics_v1_00.tsv.gz.

In this project, I have utilized a dataset from Amazon, specifically the customer reviews dataset for mobile electronics. 
I have focused my analysis on the speakersâ€™ sector within the electronics category. 

By performing various text mining techniques, including topic clustering, topic modeling, model development, and model comparison, 
I aim to extract valuable insights from the customer reviews and ratings of speakers on Amazon.
